___

userstyles for [Roblox](https://roblox.com/) that make the site look similar to how they did over a decade ago

all of these require btroblox & having the *light theme* enabled in your roblox account settings . no exemption!

two of these (2010 & 2011) require some sort of userscript manager to use properly. tampermonkey is preferred!

## currently contains:
- 2014-esque - [![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://github.com/sayorisocks/robsblocks/raw/main/2014/2014.user.css)
