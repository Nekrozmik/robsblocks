userstyles for [roblox.com](https://roblox.com/) that attempt to make the site look similar to how they did over a decade ago! that's pretty cool i think..

all of these require [btroblox](https://www.google.com/search?q=btroblox) & having the *light theme* enabled in your [roblox account settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account) . no exemption!

two of these (2010 & 2011) require some sort of userscript manager to use properly. tampermonkey is preferred!
